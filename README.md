Recipe crawler for Beaney
=========================

Hey Beans, this will run over a set of urls that you specify and then pull out the
description and image.

- [urls_to_crawl.txt](urls_to_crawl.txt): this should be a list of the urls that you want to check
- [output.csv](output.csv): this is where the script will output to when it's done

To run the script, you'll need python version 2.

You can run `python --version` and it should say something like `Python 2.7.10`.

If the python version is 3, we might need to change some things.

You can run the script with

```
python recipe_crawler.py
```

You should be able to download this entire repo, there should be a "Download zip" button
above this text.

Cheers,
Mark
